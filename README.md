# Note_Taker

### Goal

To make an app that would be able to save user notes, delete notes, and create new notes.

### Development

Using CRUD operations, I was able to code routes for the app to follow

### Problems

For some reason, the buttons on the page don't work. I looked at my routing code to see if there was any problems, but I cant think of any. If you manage to find the problem, please feel free to contact me at "ellisdelgado13@gmail.com"! Thank you!
