## About

I was tasked with making an app that would be able to save user notes, delete notes, and create new notes. The app runs on Heroku and utilizes Express to make the various API calls that it needs!

## Development

Using CRUD operations, I was able to code routes for the app to follow. The buttons now work on the page! Success!
